# OneKey Pro2 Bluetooth Firmware

This repo contains bluetooth firmware for OneKey Pro2

The firmware is based on NRF5 SDK 16.0.0, and build with CMake

## Architecture

The FindMy ADK (Accessory Development Kit) is linked to the executable as a static library, providing the core FindMy functionality for the Bluetooth firmware. The library can be found in the `fmnadk/` directory.

## How to build

```shell
# make sure you have cmake, Python 3, and aarm-none-eabi toolchain available in PATH

# export your OWN key for firmware signing
export BT_SIG_PK=$(cat <<EOF
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF
)

# call build script
./build.sh
```

## CMake Build Targets

```shell
# ota image
OnekeyProBTFW_OTA_BIN

# full HEX image
OnekeyProBTFW_FACTORY_HEX

# flash full HEX image with jlink
OnekeyProBTFW_FLASH_FACTORY
```

## How to verify firmware hash

Install Python 3.x

Download latest `ota.bin`, open a terminal in the same folder, invoke python, then run following code

```python
import struct, hashlib

with open("ota.bin", mode="br") as f:
    f.seek(0x0C)
    codelen = struct.unpack("i", f.read(4))[0] - 512
    f.seek(0x600)
    print("".join(format(x, "02x") for x in hashlib.sha256(f.read(codelen)).digest()))
```

Single line version

```python
exec("""\nimport struct, hashlib\nwith open("ota.bin", mode="br") as f:\n    f.seek(0x0C)\n    codelen = struct.unpack("i", f.read(4))[0] - 512\n    f.seek(0x600)\n    print("".join(format(x, "02x") for x in hashlib.sha256(f.read(codelen)).digest()))\n""")
```
